          Hi!
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I'm Kim, a software engineer based in the Washington, DC area.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I love creating things, whether that be through silly little doodles or full-blown development projects.
          In my free time, I like playing video games (both console and PC - I'm also a particularly huge Pok√©mon nut).
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Right now, I'm currently looking for an opportunity to work on meaningful projects with a motivated, creative team.
